When looking at geographic variation of songs we usually want to compare the spectrograms from different individuals and sites. This can be challenging when working with large number of signals, individuals and/or sites. The new [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR) function `catalog` aims to simplify this task.

This is how it works: 

* The function plots a matrix of spectrograms from signals listed in a selection table (a data frame similar to the example data frame `selec.table` in [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR))
* This graphs are saved as image files in the working directory (or path provided)
* Several images are generated if the number of signals don't fit in a single file 
* Spectrograms can be labeled or color tagged to facilitate exploring variation related to the parameter of interest (e.g. site, song type)
A legend can be added to help match colors with tag levels and different color palettes can be used for each tag
* The duration of the signals can be "fixed" so all the spectrograms have the same duration (and can be compared more easily)
* Users can control the number of rows and columns as well as the width and height of the output image


Below is a short tutorial showing some of this features. To be able to run the code you need [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR) 1.1.6 or higher, which has not been released on CRAN and it's only available in the most recent development version on github. It can be installed using the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools)) package as follows

```{r , eval=F}
#run it only if devtools isn't installed
install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("maRce10/warbleR")
require("warbleR")

```


Load the package and save the example sound files as .wavs in the working directory 

```{r, eval = F}
 
library(warbleR)

data(list = c("Phae.long1", "Phae.long2", "Phae.long3", 
              "Phae.long4", "selec.table"))
writeWave(Phae.long1,"Phae.long1.wav")
writeWave(Phae.long2,"Phae.long2.wav")
writeWave(Phae.long3,"Phae.long3.wav")
writeWave(Phae.long4,"Phae.long4.wav")
```

The basic catalog plots the spectrograms of the signals listed in 'X'. 'X' is simply a data frame with the name of sound files and the temporal position of the signals in those sound files (as in the `selec.table` example data). The following code creates a catalog with 2 columns and 5 rows labeled with the sound file name and selection number (default `labels` argument)

```{r, eval = F}

catalog(X = selec.table[1:10,], flim = c(1, 10), nrow = 5, ncol = 2, 
        same.time.scale = TRUE, mar = 0.01, wl = 200, gr = FALSE)
```

![catalog1](/img/Catalog_p1-.png)

Spectrograms can be color-tagged using the `tags` argument. A legend is added when `legend` = TRUE. The duration can also be allowed to vary between spectrograms setting `same.time.scale`= TRUE

```{r, eval = F}

catalog(X = selec.table[1:10,], flim = c(1, 10), nrow = 5, ncol = 2, 
        same.time.scale = FALSE, mar = 0.01, wl = 200, 
        gr = FALSE, tags = c("sound.files"), leg.wd = 10)
```
  
![catalog2](/img/Catalog_p1-2.png)

Two color tags can be used at the same times (`tags` argument) using different color palettes for each tag (`tag.pal` argument). The code below also uses a different color palette for the spectrogram (`pal` argument) and set `orientation` of the output image file to horizontal
  
```{r, eval = F}
  
catalog(X = selec.table[1:10,], flim = c(1, 10), nrow = 5, ncol = 2, 
        same.time.scale = TRUE, mar = 0.01, wl = 200, gr = FALSE, 
        orientation = "h",  tags = c("sound.files", "selec"), leg.wd = 10)
```

![catalog3](/img/Catalog_p1-3.png)

Many more columns and rows can be displayed. In this example a bigger selection data frame is created by combining binding several times the data used in the previous examples. The code also creates some new (hypothetical) data for song type and site> Note that the data is sorted by sites so songs from the same site are closer in the catalog

```{r, eval = F}

#create bigger data
Y <- selec.table

for(i in 1:4) Y <- rbind(Y, Y)

#simulated columns
  Y$songtype <- sample(letters[1:3], nrow(Y), replace = T)
  Y$site <- rep(letters[4:25], nrow(Y))[1:nrow(Y)]

  #sort by site and the by song type 
Y <- Y[sort(Y$site, Y$songtype), ]
  
  
catalog(X = Y, flim = c(1, 10), nrow = 12, ncol = 5, cex = 2, leg.wd = 8,
        same.time.scale = TRUE, mar = 0.01, wl = 200, gr = FALSE,
        labels = c("sound.files","songtype", "site"), legend = TRUE, 
 width = 23, height = 30, tag.pal = list(terrain.colors, temp.colors),
  tags = c("songtype", "site"))


```

 The first image would look like this (several image are produced in the signals don't fit in a single one)

 ![catalog4](/img/Catalog_p1-4.png)

When several levels are displayed in a tag colors could become very similar. In that case cross-hatched labels can be used using the `hatching` argument. Either one or both color tags can be cross-hatched
 
```{r, eval = F}

#create bigger data
Y <- selec.table

for(i in 1:4) Y <- rbind(Y, Y)

#simulated columns
Y$songtype <- sample(letters[1:3], nrow(Y), replace = T)
Y$site <- rep(letters[4:25], nrow(Y))[1:nrow(Y)]

#sort by site and then by song type 
Y <- Y[sort(Y$site, Y$songtype), ]
  
  
catalog(X = Y, flim = c(1, 10), nrow = 12, ncol = 5, cex = 2, leg.wd = 8,
        same.time.scale = TRUE, mar = 0.01, wl = 200, gr = FALSE,
        labels = c("sound.files","songtype", "site"), legend = TRUE, 
 width = 23, height = 30, tag.pal = list(terrain.colors, temp.colors),
  tags = c("songtype", "site"), hatching = 2)


```

 The following plots show a nice example of song geographic variation of [Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis)](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Cardinal/id) in Mexico (from my collaborator Marco Ortiz).

The function has other arguments to specify spectrogram settings (e.g. margin, grid, frequency limits) and image parameters (e.g. image type, resolution). Check out the function help document.

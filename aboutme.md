### Marcelo Araya-Salas
<font size="4"><center>Marcelo Araya-Salas</center></font>

I am postdoctoral associate at the Lab of Ornithology [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](http://www.birds.cornell.edu/Page.aspx?pid=1478), Cornell University. I am broadly interested in the evolution of behavior from a evolutionary and cultural perspective, as well as the interplay between these two. I worked on hummingbird signaling behavior during my PhD, and also explored the evolution of learned vocal signals in other groups using comparative analyses. I plan to expand these research avenues during my time at the Lab of O. 

I have also been involved in the development of computational tools for the analysis of animal vocalizations on the R platform. [Grace Smith-Vidaurre](http://gsmithvi.github.io/) and I have made available the R package [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR) that provides tools to streamline acoustic analysis of animal sounds. Check my [website](http://marceloarayasalas.weebly.com/) for more info about my work.

I am currenlty a postdoctoral associate at the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](http://www.birds.cornell.edu/Page.aspx?pid=1478). My research focuses on using Neotropical study systems and novel analytical methods to investigate the (evolutionary) behavioral ecology of birds. I have also been involved in the development of computational tools for the analysis of animal vocalizations on the R platform. [Grace Smith-Vidaurre](http://gsmithvi.github.io/) and I have made available the R package [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR) that provides tools to streamline acoustic analysis of animal sounds. Check my [website](http://marceloarayasalas.weebly.com/) for more info about my work.

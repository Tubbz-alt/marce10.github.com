### <center> Marcelo Araya-Salas </center>

I am a postdoctoral associate at the Lab of Ornithology [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](http://www.birds.cornell.edu/Page.aspx?pid=1478), Cornell University. I am broadly interested in the evolution of behavior from a evolutionary and cultural perspective, as well as the interplay between these two. I worked on hummingbird behavior during my PhD, and also explored the evolution of learned vocal signals in other groups using comparative analyses. I plan to expand these research avenues during my time at the Lab of O. 

I also made computational tools for the analysis of animal vocalizations on R. [Grace Smith-Vidaurre](http://gsmithvi.github.io/) and I created the R package  [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR), which provides tools to streamline high-throughput acoustic analysis of animal sounds. I also mantain the R package [Rraven](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rraven) to exchange data between R and Raven sound analysis software. Check my [website](http://marceloarayasalas.weebly.com/) for more info about my work. Pura vida.

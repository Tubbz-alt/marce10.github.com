# Bioacoustics in R

### R code for the analysis of animal acoustic signals

I have accumulated a bunch of codes for obtaining, exploring, manipulating and measuring bird songs in R.  Some of this code has been made available in the warbleR package. However, many analyses require more elaborated routines. I will make available some of those scripts here.

The advantage of R over most common sound analysis software (e.g. Raven, SAP, Avisoft) is its higher flexibility, which allows the implementation of custom made analyses that better fit the research questions and the characteristics of the vocalizations. However, this requires some proficiency in R coding that may dissuade beginners. Hopefully the codes I make available here will encourage bioacousticians to take advantage of this powerful tool.

Sound analysis in R has been made possible owing to the awesome package Seewave. I largely recommend taking a look at Seewaveâ€™s website to learn more about its different tools (functions) before trying any of the codes I am posting here. I also include functions from the package monitoR and from my own package warbleR.
